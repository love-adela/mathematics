## 1. Terminology on sets

### 1.1 Set
A **set** for us will just be a collection of elements (whatever they may be). 
It's conventional to use capital letters for sets, and lowercase letters for elements of sets.

- Example
  - H = {x|x is a featherless biped} (:set of humans)

### 1.2 Empty Set
An **empty set** is a set with no elements.
It's denoted by ∅.

### 1.3 Definition

- 1.3.1 We write x ∈ S to mean “x is in S”, for example 3 ∈ N.
- 1.3.2 If every element of a set A is also in a set B, then we say A is a subset of B, and denote this by A ⊆ B.  If moreover A != B, we say A is a **proper subset** and write A !( B.  (This is analogous to ≤ and <.) 
Given a set A, the set of all subsets is denoted 2 ** A or P(A) and called the power set of A.

- 1.3.3 We write
  - A ∪ B for the set of elements in either A or B (possibly both), called the union of A and B.
  - A ∩ B for the set of elements in both A and B, and called the intersection of A and B.
  - A \ B for the set of elements in A but not in B.

- 1.3.4 Some commonly recurring sets
  - C is the set of complex numbers
    - You would pronounce it with 'see'
  - R is the set of real numbers
    - You would pronounce it with 'are'
  - N is the set of positive integers
    - You would pronounce it with 'en'
  - Q is the set of rational numbers
    - You would pronounce it with 'cue'
  - Z is the set of integers
    - You would pronounce it with 'zee'
